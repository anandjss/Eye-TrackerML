# Eye-TrackerML
 Summer Internship Project. This code utilizes a RandomForestClassifier Machine Learning model to figure out whether a subject's eyes are either roaming or stationary. 
First, I utilize the dlib library to be able to detect faces in a given frame. By using specific landmarks within the dlib package parameter, I am able to focus on specificly 4 aspects of the subjects face: the coordinates of their outer parts of their right and left eyes, and the inner parts of their right and left eyes. After captuing these coordinates for every single frame, I then calculate the Euclidean distance between these coordinates for a given frame "i" and the previous frame, "i-1". I then create a dataframe containing 4 columns which track this Euclidean distance for the 4 categories I am examining (outer left eye, inner left eye, outer right eye, inner right eye). 
To feed the model additional information, I add a couple extra columns to the dataframe: ID and Glasses. ID is to let the model know that the subject being captured in the frame has switchedâ€”for example, the ID of my capture may be 1, while the ID of a capture of a co-worker may be 2. Glasses is a binary variable, set to zero if the subject being captured isn't wearning glasses, and 1 if they are. 
The final column added onto the dataframe prior to training the model is Fixed, which is a binary variable where "0" represents a frame in which the eyes of the subject are fixated on the same point as the previous frame, and "1" represents a frame where the eyes of the subject have roamed onto a different point than they were gazing at in the previous frame. I manually look through each frame captured and annotate them to categorize as either "fixed" or "roaming", and then this column in the dataframe is updated accordingly.
Given all this data, I create a ML model to try and predict the value of the Fixed variable. To do so, I implement a RandomForestClassifier model, as it is extremely effective for both regression and classification tasks. I take a standard 80/20 train-test split of the data accumulated, and then compare the models predictions to the actual values. With an 80/20 train test split, the model is roughly 90% accurate in predicting whether the subject being captured is fixated on a single point, or if their eyes are roaming.
